# Hands-on Web Dev AI Style Generator

This code supports the "AI Style Generator" challenge series from the [Hands-on Web Dev newsletter](https://newsletter.howd.dev).

To try the first workshop in this series, [start here](https://newsletter.howd.dev/challenges/023/)!

This workshop builds on the [React Components](https://newsletter.howd.dev/challenges/017/) workshop series. If you haven't looked at that series, you might want to start there instead.

## Getting started

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this project.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` from a web browser

You should see a page that looks like this:
